  React Features   (point to remember)

- config driven UI

- resData?.info   =>  this is optional chaining
- always use key={id} pair while iterating over the loop (map,reduce,filter  or  loop)  or else use index to iterate over the loop

- two types of export :-

1. named export
2. default export
